Lightning on Bittorrent
=======================

I'll collate the material about Lightning on Bittorrent in this repository.

In short, Lightning on Bittorrent allows one to request and receive payments when sharing data using Bittorrent, as well as sending payments when receiving data using Bittorrent. It's an idea for an extension in the Bittorrent protocol, currently in discussion stage, with a ticket opened at https://github.com/bittorrent/bittorrent.org/issues/123.

There are some proof-of-concept implementations of this extension, namely for Transmission and qBittorrent. If you're interested in these then you can find more information at https://github.com/andrewkerry/lightning-bittorrent/blob/master/usage.rst.
